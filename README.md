# Lesson 10 Final Project 200 points

# Directions

Welcome to the Final Project for the Angular2 course! Great job making it this far! This Final Project will be different from the Hands-On projects you have previously seen in a couple of different ways. For the Final Project, you will be putting together the numerous topics you have learned into one large project. It is designed to mimic real problems which you may face in your career, so it may be a challenge for you and will also take several hours. Take this project step-by-step and be aware that the project description below is written to be a bit less specific than previous Hands-Ons. The Final Project is supposed to challenge you to do some problem solving to figure out how to accomplish a task. You can always review past lessons or use a Google search if needed. Good luck!

# Requirements

Create a new Angular application from scratch using the Angular CLI tool.
Hint! This can be found in Lesson 3.

Name your project folder AngularFinalProject
Be sure to install Typescript version 2.8
This project will allow users to create and manage tasks using the four basic CRUD operations, Create, Read, Update, Delete:
A user should be to create tasks.
A user should be able to view a list of tasks by their name.
Hint! It is recommended you have one, hard-coded task so you can easily see that your list is working correctly.

A user should be able to click on an individual task.
When a task is selected, a detailed view about the task should be displayed.
This should be displayed with the URL of /:taskId.
The details should include the following:
Time to complete
Description
Necessary items needed to complete the task.
A user should be able to update a specific task on the detailed view page (/:taskId).
A user should be able to delete a specific task on the list of tasks page and on the detailed view page.
You will need to create a JSON file at the root of your project to store the tasks
Use the same JSON server to serve up this file.
This will allow you to use HTTP verbs to perform the CRUD operations.
